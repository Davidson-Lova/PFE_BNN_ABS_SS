+ Create rapport.tex
+ Begin groundwork

+ Extract data xx
+ try out BNN-ABC-SS xx

+ 29-01-2023

+ Get a working BBN-ABC-SS (that is actually working)
  + Neural Network Architecture
    + Input data dimension
    + Output data dimension
    + Layers 
      + Weighs
      + Biais
      + Activation function

Pytorch's Neural seems to be a good idea
+ Find a way to dynamical change the architecture of the neural network
+ Like for example using layers
+ Find a way to change the weights


Metropolis Hasting : 
step One
move 
calculate the evolution of the error
  if error gets better 
    let it get better
  else
    with a certain probability climb back up
    you can use the temperature to let it do just that
    it should change btw

Give it enough population
And Let enough particles live

Also, look at the distribution of the theta, 
see their variance
